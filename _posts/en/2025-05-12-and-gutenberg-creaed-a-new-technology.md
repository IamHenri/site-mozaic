The very first invention that made all this possible was the printing press.  
Beyond the invention of writing — which was, of course, a prerequisite — printing allowed for the democratization of bookmarks.

## Definition of a Bookmark

A bookmark is a key that gives direct access to information whose content needs to be quickly found again.

## Evolution

Before the printing press, in the time of hand-copied manuscripts, bookmarks were as precious as the writings themselves.  
With the Renaissance — and as a direct consequence of Gutenberg’s invention — came the democratization and creative enrichment of bookmarks.  
Then came the internet, where bookmarks found a natural home for their use, though often not to their full potential.
