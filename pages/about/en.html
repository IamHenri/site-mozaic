            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>Mozaic allows you to organise your content visually, find and access any resource in one click, and share it in two.</p>

            <h2>Origin of the Project</h2>
            <p>Mozaic was born from a simple need: to access one’s bookmarks from anywhere, regardless of the device or location.</p>
            <p>The most natural way to provide such a service is through a single web page where everything is presented as icons arranged in folders and subfolders, all accessible with a single click.</p>
